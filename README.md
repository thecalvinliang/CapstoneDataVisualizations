# CapstoneDataVisualizations
This Capstone project explores two sets of data, one pertaining to movies, and one pertaining to automobiles. I perform an exploratory data analysis on each data set and present the results with visualizations.

The project was built using Jupyter Notebooks with Python, pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. In order to view the code for this project you will need this software and libraries installed on your machine.

Included is a PDF document containing the results of the exploratory data analysis. This is for presentation purposes, without showing any code and only showing the visualizations and inferences based on the analysis.

This project was created for [Hyperion Development](www.hyperiondev.com), by myself, Calvin Liang. The data set was provided by Hyperion Development.
